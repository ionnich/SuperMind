# Unit Test

A unit test is a [[function]] that asserts behavior. If the assertion fails, the unit test fails. If the assertion succeeds, the unit tests succeeds. Following its name, a unit test must be supremely atomic. Only test one behavior, not multiples. If a behavior depends on another, create a unit test for this dependency.
