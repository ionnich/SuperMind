## Today 🔆
So I fell off. I got really busy and felt like I didn't have time to write here. This is something I should stop doing. One of the things I constantly notice about myself is that I tend to forget how good doing good things makes me feel. Writing about my day, organizing, (I want to put an extra item here, for some reason 3 items with an *and* makes me feel good about my writing), are all housekeeping tasks that keep my psyche in check. I should keep doing this.

## Journal 📔

Mood::4

Title: Bounce Back Day/Remembering how good obsidian makes me feel day

Lessons:
- Journaling is one of those inherently good things that I do in my day. Sometimes I feel like it's a waste of time until I stop. I stop then I miss it. I should keep at this so I don't miss it. It's only in moments in revelation that I realize I haven't touched my journal in far too long. It makes me feel shitty. Write more bro. Keep yourself cognizant.
